    I want to make a social media site specifically for food bloggers:
        - each account will be one's own blog
        - can search for bloggers by food categories/ key words (asian food, desserts, soups)

2. Who will use it?
    - Foodies/ recipe developers/ chefs

3. What sets this apart?
    - Won't have annoying ads like many food blogs do
    - a combination of many different people blogs so you can stay on just on site when looking for a recipe
    (many options)
